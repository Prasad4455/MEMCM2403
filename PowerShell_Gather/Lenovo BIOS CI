how to change bios settings on a Lenovo pc using SCCM CI

To change BIOS settings on a Lenovo PC using System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) Configuration Items (CI), you can follow these general steps:

## **Preparation**

1. **Understand Lenovo's BIOS Management Tools**: Lenovo does not provide a direct client configuration utility like Dell's CCTK. Instead, you need to use scripting methods, such as PowerShell or VBS, to manage BIOS settings. Lenovo provides a WMI class `lenovo_biossetting` that can be used to script BIOS changes[2].

2. **Gather Required Tools and Scripts**: You can use PowerShell scripts to manage BIOS settings. For example, the `Get-LenovoBIOSSettings` and `Set-LenovoBIOSSettings` PowerShell functions can be used to retrieve and apply BIOS settings, respectively[2][4].

## **Steps to Change BIOS Settings**

### **1. Create Configuration Data**

- **Manual Configuration**: First, manually configure the BIOS settings on a test Lenovo PC. This will allow you to extract the current settings format.
- **Extract Settings**: Use the `Get-LenovoBIOSSettings` PowerShell function to dump the BIOS settings to a text file. The command might look like this:
  ```powershell
  Get-LenovoBIOSSettings -ComputerName 'Test-Lenovo-PC'
  ```
  This will create a log file with all the BIOS settings[2].

### **2. Prepare the Deployment Script**

- **Edit the Script**: Open the log file and select the settings you want to deploy. Add these settings as strings in a list within your deployment script.
- **Apply Settings**: Use the `Set-LenovoBIOSSettings` function to apply the desired settings. Ensure the script is correctly formatted to avoid errors[2].

### **3. Deploy via SCCM**

- **Create a Configuration Item (CI)**: Use the SCCM console to create a new CI that includes your deployment script. You can use the Lenovo Configuration Pack Editor to help create and manage configuration data[1].
- **Assign the CI to a Collection**: Assign the configuration item to a collection of Lenovo PCs that require the BIOS settings update.
- **Evaluate Compliance**: Ensure that the SCCM client evaluates the configuration item to check compliance and apply the settings[1].

### **4. Troubleshooting**

- **Logging and Error Handling**: Add logging to your script to capture any errors during deployment. This can help in diagnosing issues such as incorrect setting formats or deployment failures[3].
- **Reboot Requirements**: Some BIOS settings changes may require a system reboot to take effect. Plan your deployment accordingly to include necessary reboots[3].

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and change BIOS settings on Lenovo PCs using SCCM CI. Always ensure that you have backups and a rollback plan in case of any issues during deployment.
