how to make vcenter VM customisation with out installing VMware tools on the guest

To customize a virtual machine (VM) in vCenter without installing VMware Tools on the guest operating system, you can use the following workaround:

1. **Deploy the VM from a template** or clone an existing VM.

2. **After the deployment is complete**, right-click the new VM and select **Guest OS > Customize Guest OS**[3].

3. **In the Customize Guest OS dialog**, select the desired customization specification and click OK[3].

4. **If prompted**, enter any additional required settings, such as IP address or hostname[3].

The key points are:

- **Customization is done after deployment**, not during the deployment process[3].
- **VMware Tools is not required** on the guest OS for this post-deployment customization[3].
- **A customization specification must be created beforehand** with the desired settings[1][2].

However, keep in mind that this workaround has some limitations compared to using VMware Tools for customization:

- **The customization specification cannot include a customization script** to run inside the guest OS[6].
- **Certain advanced customization options may not be available**, such as setting the computer name or joining a domain[1][2].

So in summary, while you can customize a VM without VMware Tools using this method, it provides a more limited set of options compared to installing VMware Tools on the guest OS and using the built-in customization functionality. The best approach depends on your specific requirements and guest OS.
